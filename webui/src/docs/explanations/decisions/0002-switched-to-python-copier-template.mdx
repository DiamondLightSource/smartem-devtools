# 2. Adopt python-copier-template for project structure

## Status

Superseded by ADR-0011

> **Note**: This decision was reversed on 2026-01-05. See [ADR-0011](/docs/explanations/decisions/0011-remove-python-copier-template) for details.

## Context

We should use the following [python-copier-template](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/python-copier-template).
The template will ensure consistency in developer environments and package management.

## Decision

We have switched to using the template.

## Consequences

This module will use a fixed set of tools as developed in `python-copier-template` and can pull from this
template to update the packaging to the latest techniques.

As such, the developer environment may have changed, the following could be different:

- linting
- formatting
- pip venv setup
- CI/CD
