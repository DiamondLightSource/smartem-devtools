# Kubernetes Deployment

This directory contains Kubernetes deployment configurations for SmartEM Backend across different environments.

## Quick Start (Development)

For local development, use the convenient script that provides a docker-compose-like experience:

```bash
# Start the development environment (equivalent to docker-compose up -d)
./scripts/k8s/dev-k8s.sh

# Check status (equivalent to docker ps)
./scripts/k8s/dev-k8s.sh status

# View logs for a service
./scripts/k8s/dev-k8s.sh logs smartem-http-api

# Stop the environment (equivalent to docker-compose down)
./scripts/k8s/dev-k8s.sh down

# Restart everything
./scripts/k8s/dev-k8s.sh restart

# Get help
./scripts/k8s/dev-k8s.sh --help
```

### Access URLs
Once the environment is running, you can access:
- **Adminer (Database UI)**: http://localhost:30808
- **RabbitMQ Management**: http://localhost:30673
- **SmartEM Backend HTTP API**: http://localhost:30080/health
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:30080/docs

> **Note**: The script automatically handles GitHub Container Registry authentication and waits for all pods to be ready.

## Security: Sealed Secrets

The project uses [Bitnami Sealed Secrets](https://sealed-secrets.netlify.app/) for secure credential management. Before
deploying to any environment, you must generate the appropriate sealed secrets:

### Generate Secrets for Development

```bash
# Auto-generate secure credentials for development
./scripts/k8s/generate-sealed-secrets.sh development
```

### Generate Secrets for Production

```bash
# Interactive credential input for production security
./scripts/k8s/generate-sealed-secrets.sh production
```

Sealed secrets are encrypted with the cluster's public key and safe to commit to version control. The sealed-secrets
controller automatically decrypts them into regular Kubernetes secrets that applications can use.

> **Security Note**: Never commit plain-text secrets to version control. Always use sealed secrets for credential management.

For comprehensive secret management documentation, see [Managing Kubernetes Secrets](kubernetes-secrets.md).
